### Website Preview
![preview](preview.png)

My first web development project made with sveltekit to serve as a simple startpage with easy access to bookmarks. The theme is inspired by a terminal and the dmenu tool created by suckless.

Deployed using .nojekyll thanks to this [repo](https://github.com/metonym/sveltekit-gh-pages).
